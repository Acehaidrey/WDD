		<div id="major"><span> I am a third year majoring in EECS and minoring in Energy Engineering. </span></div>
		<div id="bio"> I am originally from OC, California. I moved up to Berkeley for college and though
			I like NorCal, I ultimately hope to end up back in SoCal. I am rather new to software
			in general, both backend and front. Ultimately I'd like to end up as a full stack engineer
			so this would be good exposure! When I'm not studying/working, I like to hangout with the
			guys and grab a beer, play basketball, or just throw the baseball around at the park with
			our dog. I am passionate about energy and the environment (typical for a middle eastern, 
			I know), technology, and sports. Oh, and I'm really into traveling so if anyone wants to
			share any amazing places they've visited, please do :). Last summer I had an internship in
			Singapore and got to visit Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. I'm 
			looking forward to this course with everyone! </div>
