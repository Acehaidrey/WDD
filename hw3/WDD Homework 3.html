				<p class="caption">In the assignment folder, you can find style.css inside assets/css/ folder. You can only make changes to this file. You are not allowed to change anything in index.html. This assignment is to have you practice using CSS selectors to select any element on your website, without making any edits in your HTML. We will take off points for making changes to the HTML file. </p>
				<p class="caption">In this assignment, you will select various shapes and apply some CSS styles to only those shapes that you have selected. We will give you all the CSS styles you need, all you need to do is to just select the right shapes. (Sounds easy, huh?) In fact, we are giving away all the good colors too so you don't have to stick to the ugly default red, blue, or green. Many shapes. Much colors. Such fun.</p>
