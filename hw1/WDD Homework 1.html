				<!-- Styled Tags; P, UL, LI, .caption, A, IMG-->

				<!-- Use P Tags with "caption" class for paragraph captions (60% opacity) -->

				<p class="caption"><b>Note:</b> Please review the lecture slides before you go through this assignment.</p>
				<p>In this assignment, You will be creating a website about yourself. You will use 100% pure HTML without CSS, so it won't look the best, but will still contain structured information! (That's the purpose of HTML anyways)</p>
				<p>You will need to create a workspace folder with a name of your choice for this assignment. Remember that for each website you create, you need a workspace with <b>index.html</b>, <b>style.css</b>, and (maybe) <b>script.js</b> (review the lecture slides to structure your workspace folder correctly). You will continue to improve this homework's website in next week's homework and onwards.</p>
				<p>Here are the requirements for the website:
					</p><ol>
						<li>Write your name in huge, bold text (Hint: I'm MAD)</li>
						<li>On the next line, write your major and year in italic text (Hint: I'm fancy)</li>
						<li>Add a paragraph about yourself</li>
						<li>Add a picture of yourself so we can recognize you in class! (where should your pictures go in the workspace folder?)</li>
						<li>Add a link that, when clicked, directs you to the most beautiful website you have ever seen. The text within the link should be the name of the website.</li>
						<li>Write your favorite song in text that is both bold and italic. If we like the song you pick, we might include it in one of our class playlists!<t li="">
					</t></li></ol>
				<p></p>
				<p>Once you are done, your website should look somewhat like this: </p>

				<p class="caption">Why are we doing this? This is to have you practice the various HTML tags you learned in lecture. There are tons of HTML tags and they may seem overwhelming, but in most cases, you only use 30% of them. The tags you learned this week are used frequently, so it's crucial that you know how to use them.</p>

Starting from week 2, you will be able to download hands on material for the class as well. Please download the hands on material before the class so that there's no delay during the hands on section of the lecture.</p>

				<p>You can use the <strong>Attendance</strong> tab to check-in for each week of class by filling out the Lorem Ipsum Word of the Day. At a random point during each class, we will give out the Lorem Ipsum Word of the Day, which you will then enter in the box which says "Enter Lorem Ipsum Word of the Week".</p>
				<p>If you can't make it to class for some reason and would like to use up one of your 3 excused absences, you must submit an absence request via the the Attendance view on Portal.</p>

				<p>Finally, <strong>remember to upload your profile picture!</strong> You can change your profile picture by clicking on the image right next to your name on the top bar. By default, your profile picture will be a blue user icon. It's not required, but it will help us recognize you in class of 100+ students.</p>
